Development of a Mobile App using which the end-user can, by pressing a button submit his/her current location (latitude and longitude) to a backend server located at the Security Section.  At the back-end, on receipt of this latitude and longitude (query location) along with the time, the feeds of all the cameras at increasing distances from the query location must be made available for viewing through a select menu.  The deadline for the demonstration of this App, both front-end and back-end, will be scheduled in the first week of December 2022. 

- â€‹The user interface is left to the imagination of the team.
- The input is a lat long and time which will be generated by the user using the mobile app. Let us call it victim location
- Output must be on a screen in the server where the victim location is marked as a point and the cameras around it get marked as points. When mouse over is done on the cameras it must display. - the cameras lat long with description. One can see the feed and also start recording for each of the cameras.
- All these recording must go into a specific directory.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip
- virtualenv

## Setup

We are using MongoDB as our database. So, you need to install MongoDB on your system. You can follow the instructions given [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). or use a docker image.

- Clone the repository
- Create a virtual environment
- Activate the virtual environment
- Go to the web/backend directory
- Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory as shown in `.env.example`
- Add the variables in the `.env` file
- Make migrations using `python manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the database using `python manage.py migrate`
- Run the server using `python manage.py runserver`

We are also using Firebase for push notifications. So, you need to create a Firebase project and add the `google-services.json` from a service account (web app) file in the `web/backend/config/` directory so we can connect both the backend and the mobile app.
