# AM-I-Challenge

Development of a Mobile App using which the end-user can, by pressing a button submit his/her current location (latitude and longitude) to a backend server located at the Security Section.  At the back-end, on receipt of this latitude and longitude (query location) along with the time, the feeds of all the cameras at increasing distances from the query location must be made available for viewing through a select menu.  The deadline for the demonstration of this App, both front-end and back-end, will be scheduled in the first week of December 2022.
